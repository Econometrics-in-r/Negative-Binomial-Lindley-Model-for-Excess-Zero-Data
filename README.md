# Negative Binomial Lindley Model for Excess Zero Data
 winBUGS codes for fixed and random parameters Negative Binomial Lindley regression models

This code has been produced as a part of my doctoral research. Please cite the following article if you use this code in any kind:

Rusli, R., Haque, M.M., Afghari, A.P. and King, M., 2018. Applying a random parameters Negative Binomial Lindley model to examine multi-vehicle crashes along rural mountainous highways in Malaysia. Accident Analysis & Prevention, 119, pp.80-90.

This winBUGS code corresponds with the recently developed economtric model to deal with crash data with excess zero observations. Although this code has been written for crash count data, it may be used for any dependent variable that is of count nature (e.g. number of patients at hospitals, animal death counts, etc).
